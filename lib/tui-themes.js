/**
 * Solarized-dsh-theme — dsh-TUI theme-sync half.
 *
 * dsh-TUI has no theme registration API — custom themes are only ever read
 * from `~/.dsh-tui/themes/<name>.json`. This tiny Cordis plugin ships as a
 * second bundle row (solarized-dsh-theme/tui-themes, no inject → activates
 * in EVERY profile) and idempotently copies the four Solarized/Selenized
 * theme JSONs from this package into the TUI data dir on activation:
 *
 *   - installed into a dsh-tui profile: themes land on first TUI start —
 *     `dsh plugin --profile dsh-tui add @yuquexianzhou/solarized-dsh-theme`
 *     is the whole install;
 *   - installed into a web/desktop profile of a user who also runs dsh-TUI:
 *     themes stay in sync on every web start, no second install needed;
 *   - no `~/.dsh-tui` on disk (web-only user): strict no-op — the directory
 *     is never created by this plugin.
 *
 * The `solarized-*.json` / `selenized-*.json` namespaces are plugin-owned:
 * syncing overwrites those files when they differ from the shipped copies
 * (that is how updates propagate). Other files in the themes directory are
 * never touched.
 *
 * Best-effort by contract: any failure is swallowed silently — theme sync
 * must never drag down profile startup.
